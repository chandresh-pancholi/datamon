# List of open todos 

This repo is currently a Proof Of Concept of how the trumpet tool would work.

## Garbage collection 

Garbage collection should work out which commits are no longer referenced.
From there it needs needs to work out which blobs are no longer in use and prune those blobs.
When the blobs are pruned the bundles that represent the commits are removed.
